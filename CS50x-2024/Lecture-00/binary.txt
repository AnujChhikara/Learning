--//Basic formaula to decode binary to decimal

this is a 8 byte binary file

10101010

if we convert this to decimal
10101010 = 42

but how do we know what the decimal value of this binary file is?
we can use the following formula to convert binary to decimal

binary = 2 ^ (number of bits in binary) * decimal

so for the above binary file byte from the left
0*2 pow 0 = 0
1*2 pow 1 = 2
0*2 pow 2 = 0
1*2 pow 3 = 8
0*2 pow 4 = 0
1*2 pow 5 = 32
0*2 pow 6 = 0
1*2 pow 7 = 128

so the decimal value of the above binary file is
0 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 128 = 42


ASCII,
stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a 7-bit character code where each individual bit represents a unique character.

for exmple word Hello is represented as
H = 01001000
e = 01100101
l = 01101100
l = 01101100
o = 01101111

ASCII code for each character is
H = 72
e = 101
l = 108
l = 108 
o = 111 


Unicode
Unicode is a character encoding standard designed to support all characters from all writing systems, as well as symbols, emoji, etc.

Unicode assigns each character a unique code point (a numeric value) but uses different encoding formats to store these code points as binary data:

UTF-8: A variable-length encoding format that uses 1 to 4 bytes to store characters.
UTF-16: Uses 2 or 4 bytes to store characters.
UTF-32: Uses 4 bytes for every character.
For example, the character A in Unicode is represented by the code point U+0041, which corresponds to the decimal value 65 (the same as in ASCII).
