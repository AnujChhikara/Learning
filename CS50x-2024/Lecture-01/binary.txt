Basic formaula to decode binary to decimal

this is a 8 byte binary file

10101010

if we convert this to decimal
10101010 = 42

but how do we know what the decimal value of this binary file is?
we can use the following formula to convert binary to decimal

binary = 2 ^ (number of bits in binary) * decimal

so for the above binary file byte from the left
0*2 pow 0 = 0
1*2 pow 1 = 2
0*2 pow 2 = 0
1*2 pow 3 = 8
0*2 pow 4 = 0
1*2 pow 5 = 32
0*2 pow 6 = 0
1*2 pow 7 = 128

so the decimal value of the above binary file is
0 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 128 = 42
