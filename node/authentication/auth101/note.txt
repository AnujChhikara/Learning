Statefull authentication

when a user logs in , we assign a unique token to the user
and we store the token in the database
when the user makes a request we check the token in the database
if the token is valid we allow the user to make the request
otherwise we deny the request

methods to do it
1. cookie
2. headers

mostly validating is done by a auth middleware
