Statefull authentication

when a user logs in , we assign a unique token to the user
and we store the token in the database
when the user makes a request we check the token in the database
if the token is valid we allow the user to make the request
otherwise we deny the request

methods to do it
1. cookie
2. headers

mostly validating is done by a auth middleware

***************
   cookies
**************

if you have cookies stored in your browser they auto send from frontend with every request you 
made with the backend

cookies config 
  - name: sessionId
  - maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 // -- this means the cookie will expire after 30 days
  - httpOnly: true -- this means the cookie will not be accessible from the client side javascript
  - secure: true -- this means the cookie will only be sent over https
  - sameSite: 'strict' -- ensures that the cookie is only sent when navigating within the same site/domain and not sent in cross-site requests.
